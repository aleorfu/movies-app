# Introduction

This project is part of my practice in Alten. It's a React Native project in which we have to implement from scratch some features, also we have the freedom to add any custom feature, as I'm doing.

# Decisions

## Alten Hybrid API

### Axios or Fetch

I researched about these two methods of making petitions to the API, I found out that Axios, unlike Fetch, can be used on a wide range of devices, also facilitate petitions by allowing the creations of differents instances with default settings. So I choosed Axios.

## Data storage

### SQLite or AsyncStorage

Upon receipt of this decision I first thought about use AsyncStorage, this is because AsyncStorage is simpler and works better with a small amount of data (being this an small project), but when I entered to the documentation page I realised that AsyncStorage is deprecated, so to use an actual data storage service I choosed SQLite. However I uninstalled SQLite because I thought it wasn't necesary yet, we musn't have code we don't use.

# Exercises

## Package Manager

Package managers are fundamental tools in modern software development, especially in web development environments.
Their main function is to facilitate the management, installation, update and removal of dependencies of a software project.

I have to talk about three of them:

- **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is the default package manager for Node.js, the server-side JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to install packages of JavaScript code available in the public npm registry. npm also allows developers to publish their own packages for others to use.

- **Yarn:** Yarn is another package manager for JavaScript that was created to address some perceived limitations in npm, such as speed and consistency of installations. Yarn uses a more efficient dependency resolution algorithm and performs package installations faster than npm. In addition, Yarn includes features such as parallel package installation and the generation of a yarn.lock file to ensure consistent installations.

- **pnpm:** Similar to Yarn, pnpm is a package manager that focuses on efficiency and speed of installation. Unlike npm and Yarn, pnpm takes a shared storage approach, which means that dependencies are not duplicated in each project, but are stored centrally, which can save disk space.

Now, I will talk about .lock files. Lock files (such as package-lock.json in npm, yarn.lock in Yarn, or pnpm-lock.yaml in pnpm) are files automatically generated by package managers to ensure reproducibility of installations. They contain detailed information about the exact versions of all installed dependencies, along with their sub-dependencies and their versions. This ensures that, when installing dependencies in a different environment or at a different time, the exact same versions are used, thus avoiding discrepancies that could cause compatibility problems or unexpected behavior.

As for why you should not use more than one package manager per project, the main reason is possible inconsistency in dependency management. Each package manager handles its own lock files and dependency resolution algorithms, which could result in conflicts if multiple managers are used in the same project. In addition, this can lead to confusion and make collaboration between developers more difficult, as each developer might be more familiar with a specific manager. In summary, it is advisable to choose a single package manager per project and maintain consistency in its use.

### Instalation

#### Windows

1. The first step for nvm installation is uninstalling the local version of Node.
2. Then we download `nvm-setup.exe` from it's original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), when downloaded just execute it.
3. To use it, we must open as administrator a PowerShell, for installing 18 and lts version, we have to run the following:
   - `nvm install 18.0.0`
   - `nvm install lts`
4. To use lts version, we have to run: `nvm use lts`.

#### Linux

1. The first step for nvm installation is uninstalling the local version of Node.
2. Then we open a terminal and run `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash`, because of it being outdate, you should visit their original repository on [Github](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
3. To use it, we must open a new terminal, for installing 18 and lts version, we have to run the following:
   - `nvm install 18.0.0`
   - `nvm install --lts`
4. To use lts version, we have to run: `nvm use --lts`.
